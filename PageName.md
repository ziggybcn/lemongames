This the LemonBytes minimalistic game's framework


# Details #

This is the minimalistic game's framework we're using at LemonBytes to produce our Games and Apps using the wonderful Monkey programming language.

Take a look if you want. We're not going to add documentation, samples, or any additional information anytime soon, due to terrible workload, but if you have any questions, feel free to contact ziggy at monkeycoder.co.nz and make any questions you may have,
